## Setup

It is recommended to develop inside a Python virtual environment. To set one at see the [[venv documentation]](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work). Here is a quickstart for Linux.

```shell
# Install environment in venv directory within this repository.
python3 -m venv ./venv

# Active the environment. This is required for each fresh scripting session.
source venv/bin/activate
```
